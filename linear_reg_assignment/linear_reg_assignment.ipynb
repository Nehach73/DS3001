Compare the coefficients in the regression to the table from part 1. What pattern do you see? What are the coefficients in a regression of a continuous variable on one categorical variable?\n",

Split the sample 80/20 into a training and a test set and run a regression including that kind of \"property type X neighborhood\" dummy, plus `Review Scores Rating`. How does the slope coefficient for `Review Scores Rating`, the $R^2$, and the RMSE change? Do they increase significantly compares to part 5? Are the coefficients in this regression just the sum of the coefficients for `Neighbourhood ` and `Property Type` from 5? What is the most expensive kind of property you can rent?"

Clean the data however you think is most appropriate.\n",
        "  2. Summarize the `Price` variable and create a kernel density plot. Use `.groupby()` and `.describe()` to summarize prices by brand (`Make`). Make a grouped kernel density plot by `Make`. Which car brands are the most expensive? What do prices look like in general?\n",

As you increase the degree of the expansion, how do the $R^2$ and `RMSE` change? At what point does $R^2$ go negative on the test set? For your best model with expanded features, what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE`? How does it compare to your best model from part 4?\n",

Do the predicted values and true values roughly line up along the diagonal, or not? Compute the residuals/errors for the test data and create a kernel density plot. Do the residuals look roughly bell-shaped around zero? Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your model."
