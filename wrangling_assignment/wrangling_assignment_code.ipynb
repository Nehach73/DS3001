        "1. This paper is about going beyond data cleaning (removing NAs and making sure every row is formatted correctly) and considering data tidying. Data tidying involves representing data is a simple, consistent format that can be manipulated and visualized easily through rows and columns in tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The \"tidy data standard\" aims to provide a standard way to organize data values within a dataset. It facilitates the initial cleaning and exploration of data and simplifies the development of data analysis tools for the given data.\n",

        "3. The first sentence means that every tidy dataset is similar and can be analyzed and manipulated in the same way. However, all messy datasets need not be alike, because the semantics of the data is up to the person who designed the dataset and can vary from person to person. The second sentence speaks about how it is easy to visually distinguish between variables and observations but it is harder to infer their true meaning. The purpose of a value can be lost due to vague column headings or grouped observations.\n",
